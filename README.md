#  Flappy Bird Game with A.I and Human mode
### This game was made using python as programming language, neat as A.I library and pygame to make the interface. 

- ### How to run the project??
    -  Remember to install neat and pygame.
    -  inside the project folder, run  in the terminal the following command: `py Menu.py`.

- ### Game variables 
    In the file `flappyBird_AI.py` there are 3 constants that can receive the values `True` or `False`:
    - ##### DRAW_LINES
        Shows the lines between birds and pipes.
    - ##### MOVE_PIPES
        Moves the pipes vertically, making the game more difficult.
    - ##### SHOW_PIRANHA [ In development, but you can see how it's going :) ]
        This makes the game even more difficult, every 5 pipes a boss appears and shoots fireballs, the bird receives a special power that can only be used every 4 pipes, so he must learn to maintain the power to use only when the piranha appears.
